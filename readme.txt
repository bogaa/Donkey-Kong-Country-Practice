Special thanks to Mattrizzle for sharing infos about the game. 
Also Rainbow here a link to his hacking discord: https://discord.gg/qSYRzMqD4F 

-  Game loads full save at startup and in the file select screen hit select to listen to different music tracks.
-  Start Select out of any level.

In game pause menu:
- Lives press right left to choose amount of lives press B to remove current level checkpoint.
- Bonus press B to spawn bonus-items-selected.
- Animals press B to spawn helper.
- Save and Load use in-game-save that is still a bit broken. Currently just works for current level. You can Start Select out of the level go in and still use the save state. But will be gone once you move in the over-world. Sometimes there are palette bugs you can fix when going out and in the level then load the savestate. 

Hot Button functions:
- Hold R + X to quick load last savestate. You need to have a savestate for this to work in the level.
- Hold L and press X to toggle full debug mode to fly and view the level (same as here https://tcrf.net/Donkey_Kong_Country_(SNES)#Debug_Functions )
- Hold L and R will toggle other menus and I modded the camera debugg to show current player speed and hitboxes. There is a stop watch that counts frames till you reach a transition and will show the room time on the top right as well.

Hold L+R on the map to quickly switch the level below you with a flight level to quickly go to other stages. I think this is all I did so far

There are a lot of bugs I did not bother to fix so far. Here are the once that come to my mind.

- water,snow,cave levels seem to load artefacts sometimes.
- levels with palette animations can break savestating
- some times save/load palette fails intierly  
...many others.
